Repository commits after PR #28 that only align documentation do not change the installed Blogger product payload.

## Current production state

Blogger Real is running the Q-035 shell produced after PR #28. The shell retains exactly one `#page_body`, exactly one `Blog1`, no `zen_main`, the v0.9.2 application graph, auxiliary Admin/About/Inspector runtime, and the protected Zen Radio Player v1.0.3 loader.

The public editorial profile remains mutable through `config/site-profile.public.json`; code, CSS and application assets remain commit-pinned. No GitHub token is embedded in the XML or JavaScript, and publication credentials are not persisted in browser storage or URLs.

## HASH-COMPOUND-001

Previous Blogger Real failure:
`https://cubalahojaderuta.blogspot.com/#zen-explore/admin`

Observed result before PR #28: Portada.

Correction:
- the public ZenBlog entry does not boot on Admin-owned pathname/hash forms;
- Admin/runtime remains the owner of `/admin`, path-suffix `/admin` and hash-suffix `/admin` routes;
- normal public hashes remain owned by public navigation.

Post-deployment Blogger Real result in Q-035: `PASS`.

## Automated verification

PR #28 `Validate ZenBlog`:
- Run ID: `32677678214`
- Run number: `261`
- Conclusion: `SUCCESS`
- JavaScript checks: `PASS`
- Unit tests: `86/86 PASS`
- About same-origin browser smoke: `PASS`
- About Admin-to-public field parity browser contract: `PASS`
- Admin/public bootstrap ownership browser contract: `PASS`
- Blogger XML parse: `PASS`
- Architecture invariants: `PASS`
- Protected Blogger/player invariants: `PASS`

PR #29 documentation-only validation:
- Run ID: `32678243087`
- Run number: `263`
- Conclusion: `SUCCESS`

PR #30 documentation-only validation:
- Run ID: `32678515932`
- Run number: `265`
- Conclusion: `SUCCESS`

CI is not Blogger Real QA and is not Safari/iPhone/WebKit QA.

## Blogger Real QA — Q-035

- QA-HF-004 Search / Search Lab: `PASS`.
  - Real status observed: `2 artículos indexados.`
  - Query exercised: `pueblo`.
- QA-HF-006 Inspector: `PASS`.
- QA-HF-007 leave Admin / return to public site: `PASS`.
- QA-HF-009 Zen Radio Player / ZenBlog navigation boundary: `PASS`.
- HASH-COMPOUND-001 after PR #28 deployment: `PASS`.

## Safari / iPhone / WebKit real acceptance

Final real-device gate in Q-035: `PASS`.

Product Owner verified on iPhone + Safari:
- Portada -> Explorar -> Acerca de navigation usable;
- no reported critical safe-area overlap;
- player coexistence with mobile UI;
- portrait/landscape transition without reported critical cut, overlap or horizontal overflow;
- Admin tabs usable;
- `Sitio ↗` visible in mobile format.

`ADMIN-RESPONSIVE-OBS-001` is closed as `NOT A DEFECT`.

## About / public profile state

- About Manager mounts and local save works.
- Production publication to `config/site-profile.public.json` works.
- Public read uses direct raw `main` with cache-busting.
- Admin -> main -> public read -> render parity was demonstrated in Blogger Real for the tested case.
- PR #27 corrected field parity for Género, Audio Clip, Wishlist, Pregunta aleatoria, Respuesta, Intereses, Películas favoritas, Música favorita and Libros favoritos.
- Only Intereses has individual manual Blogger Real verification; the remaining eight have automated CI coverage.

## Open non-blocking observation

### PERFORMANCE-OBS-001

Admin was perceived as somewhat slow. No before/after metric exists. Do not classify this as a performance regression and do not open a performance hotfix without measurement.

This observation is non-blocking and does not invalidate FROZEN because there is no reproducible performance defect or failed acceptance criterion.

## Protected neighbor / future ZRP work

Zen Radio Player remains an independent protected product at loader `v1.0.3`.

Q-035 queued `ZRP-UX-IMPROVEMENT-001` for a future code phase:
- preserve minimized initial open and autoplay behavior;
- clicking the minimized player should expand the complete player surface, including controls plus playback/reproduction bar;
- preserve playlist behavior, persistence, ZenBlog navigation, and the protected product boundary.

This request is explicitly future work and is not part of frozen ZenBlog v0.9.2.

## Freeze disposition

`FROZEN = YES`.

All currently defined automated, Blogger Real, routing, player-boundary and Safari/iPhone/WebKit technical gates are closed. The Product Owner explicitly accepted `FROZEN` in Q-035 on 2026-08-23 America/New_York.

FROZEN means this v0.9.2 state is the accepted stable baseline. Future work must begin from this baseline as a new controlled phase; freeze does not prohibit future changes.

## Current rollback reference

The immediately previous Q-034 production XML remains the pre-PR28 rollback reference:
- XML SHA-256: `6ea67c63f0f199fd110d720da31023e5206e58fb6b368bf1cdd311d28dbfe520`
- Previous payload pin: `578f58f17f242f9e48a1c8627676541de29a5fa8`

The original pre-v0.9.2 forensic rollback artifact remains preserved separately under `docs/forensic/artifacts/`.

## Evidence files

Final Q-035 real QA:
`docs/forensic/Q035-FINAL-REAL-QA-2026-08-23.txt`

Explicit freeze acceptance:
`docs/forensic/Q035-FREEZE-ACCEPTANCE-2026-08-23.txt`

## Authority rule

This manifest records repository release state. The final Q-035 continuity package is the operational handoff authority for the frozen baseline, and Blogger Real/Safari real evidence cannot be inferred from CI.
